Quite the rarity indeed. I'll tell you that in my younger days I dabbled a bit in piloting, but I never - NEVER - got anywhere nearly as good as you are. Here is your 150000 credits. You have certainly earned every single one of them. Have you by the way ever seen New Portland at this time of year? I hear it is quite pleasant and was considering going there sometime soon."

We were on our way there for the Baron to study the famous dikes, and landed on Ingot for refuelling, when a our previous captain unfortunately fell into a spell of bad luck, and had his ship confiscated by the local authorities. Personally I never liked the man, he drank too much and bathed to little, but the Baron was quite fond of him. And while the man was a bit gruff, he was always very discreet about transporting His Highness the Baron. Should you be interested the Baron would require a similar discretion for you. His Highness the Baron will require transport for himself and 17 servants, and their combined luggage of 30 pieces. Will you be able to perform such a task under these conditions?"`

The Baron is followed by a slim, younger man holding an umbrella over the Baron's head. As he get closer, you notices that his fingers and ears are covered in jewels. Before you know it you are in the front of your ship's controls and on the way. And you never got any of that glargh-stew...`
