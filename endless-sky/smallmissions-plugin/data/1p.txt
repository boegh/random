That night, as you wait in line for your tickets, you get into a chat with an old man. "I used to captain my own ship he laughs. A lot of good adventures. A lot of exciting times. You know often the good missions are in the Spaceport, but the Job board is a good and steady source of income. Especially to and from Earth, there can be easy missions paying a lot on the Job board, so don't dismiss that place entirely - especially when you are a green and young captain." He gets his tickets, laughs, wishes you well and leave into the theater.`
