# nmap on WSL currently doesn't work as AF_PACKET needed by nmap (and other tools like wireshark) is not yet implemented.
# solution: Install the Windows version and alias to it from WSL
# See https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1349

nmap() {
    /mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Nmap/nmap.exe $@
